<b>Summary</b>. This thesis work aims to design and develop an Android application, called Infocard, able to better manage contacts through a "smart" address book with some references to typical social network functions. In particular, through a system of requests, it is possible to view the personal data of users, such as profile picture, nickname, name, surname, especially e-mail and telephone number, and keep them close at hand within Infocard.

<b>BACKGROUND AND REASONS</b> <br>
Taking advantage of it in many respects, it is increasingly common to have / change more telephone numbers and more e-mails. When a change or addition occurs, the user should notify all contacts. For this reason I have developed an application that updates itself automatically.

<b>CONTRIBUTION</b> <br>
Through a system of requests, authorization is requested from other users to view the data. Developed via Android Studio (in Java) and server side with the use of Firebase.
<br> !!! Attention to privacy, the possibility of occupy less phone memory, also reducing the risk of losing information. !!!

<b>FUTURE WORKS</b>
- Ability to click on the number or e-mail and be able to call or send the e-mail directly.
- Ability to revoke access to users or to show only a part of the contacts.
- Ability to add additional fields to display, such as information on social networks.
